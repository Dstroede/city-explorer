## Overview
This application is a website that can give you information on any city that you enter. the application can provide information such as: map, weather, lattitude/longitude and more!

## Getting Started
In order to start building an app like this you must create a new repository and add the necessary react/bootstrap/axios dependencies. From here you will also need to add an api key from location IQ. Then we create a back end that allows us to take our location and find the weather

## Architecture
This app features javascript/react/bootstrap/axios/locationIQ/vite and more

## Change Log
